# Challenlink PHP Challenge

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to the Challenlink PHP challenge, focusing on clean, efficient, and well-documented code using OOP principles.

## Challenges
- **Find the Point**: Efficiently solves a geometric or search problem using OOP.
- **Don't Iterate**: Demonstrates solving a problem without explicit iteration, leveraging recursion or built-in PHP functions.
- **Spaghetti Code**: Shows how to avoid tangled, hard-to-maintain code by using clear structure and OOP.

## Structure
- `src/` — PHP classes for each challenge
- `tests/` — Test scripts for each solution

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have PHP 8.0+ installed.
2. Run each solution from the command line:
   ```bash
   php src/FindThePoint.php
   php src/DontIterate.php
   php src/SpaghettiCode.php
   ```
3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   php tests/FindThePointTest.php
   php tests/DontIterateTest.php
   php tests/SpaghettiCodeTest.php
   ```

## OOP Principles
- Each solution is encapsulated in a class.
- Code is modular, reusable, and easy to extend.
- PHPDoc comments are provided for clarity.
